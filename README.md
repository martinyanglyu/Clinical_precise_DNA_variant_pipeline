# Clinical_precise_DNA_variant_pipeline (CPDV)
This is the pipeline that used for clinical precise variant calling from whole genome sequencing (will update it for whole exome sequencing late). This pipeline was tested in NF1 assoicated tumors such as Plexform and MPNST.
* Raw data : fastq files
* Samples types: Normal, tumor and PDX
* Output: Germline SNV, Germline structure variant, Somatic SNV, Somatic structure variant, Copy number variant, Clonality
